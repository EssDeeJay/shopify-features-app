# Shopify Remix, Prisma, MongoDB App - Red Ruby

This app uses shopify's remix along with prisma ORM for schema and MongoDB for Database operations.

The reason for using MongoDB is due to its simple nature of adapting any datatype rather than SQLite type and also is specific to the app i am building.

This app is solely for the purpose for education and all the functionalities i am creating are as part of the learing. This can be improved and used in Production.

Feel free to clone or use it for your own reference. when you do so, please star my repository.
